My first [Node app](http://dvni1fcnlsxbv.cloudfront.net/underperforming/viral) consumes Metro's newsfeed API, filtering out articles with the highest social score to produce a list of the stories most likely to succeed on social media. As well as a Bootstrap UI, with an alternative version for office display screens, the app also provides JSON output and periodically sends a notification to Slack. I set this up as an AWS microservice with load balancer behind CloudFront, with Forever restarting the app on reboot. ([GitHub](https://github.com/andfinally/node-underperforming).)
