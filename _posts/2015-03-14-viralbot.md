My first [Node app](http://dvni1fcnlsxbv.cloudfront.net/underperforming/viral) consumes Metro's newsfeed API, filtering out articles with the highest social score. Periodically sends notification to Slack. JSON output as well as Bootstrap UI, with an alternative version for office display screens. I set this up on my first AWS instance with load balancer behind CloudFront, with Forever as an init service. ([GitHub](https://github.com/andfinally/node-underperforming).)
